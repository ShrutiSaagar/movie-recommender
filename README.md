# MovieMind - AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System

MovieMind is an interactive AI-powered movie recommendation system that addresses three common issues with traditional recommendation engines:

1. **Novel Combination Understanding**: MovieMind can analyze unique genre/plot combinations or unconventional storytelling approaches to find truly comparable movies.

2. **Dynamic User Taste Adaptation**: The system responds to real-time user feedback and understands deeper reasons for preferences beyond simple genre labels.

3. **Diverse Exploration**: When users indicate what they don't want, MovieMind explores a wide range of different options rather than focusing only on the opposite of what they disliked.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface for natural conversation about movie preferences
- Visual representation of genre preferences with adjustable weights
- Filter options for ratings, movie length, and release years
- Keyword tagging for specific themes, actors, directors, etc.
